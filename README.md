# My Portfolio

Having a portfolio of my own was always something I personally wanted. But developing it on my own is **THE THING** I am proud of most *Right Now.*

I would keep updating it as time passes by.

Made with ❤️ by **EK** using <img src="https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/designer-skills/128/react-512.png" width="30"> and deployed via Netlify.
